# R
Scripts and custom functions written in R, mostly for eye tracking data processing

These scripts were written during my stay at LMU-Munich and were used mainly for my M.Sc. and PhD projects.

I am trying to bring those scripts further in the other repository (rGaze) to make a complete package for eye tracking data processing and analysis.
